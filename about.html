        <p>The history of e-commerce traces back to the early 1970s when electronic data interchange (EDI) emerged, allowing businesses to exchange documents electronically. However, the true catalyst for e-commerce came with the advent of the internet in the 1990s. In 1994, Phil Brandenberger made the first online sale of a Sting CD to a friend, marking the beginning of e-commerce as we know it.
    
            Throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s, companies like Amazon and eBay revolutionized online retail, offering a wide array of products and services to consumers worldwide. The dot-com bubble, despite its burst in the early 2000s, laid the groundwork for the future of online commerce by showcasing the potential of internet-based businesses.
            
            The 2010s saw the rise of mobile commerce (m-commerce) with the proliferation of smartphones and tablets. Companies optimized their platforms for mobile devices, making shopping more accessible than ever before. Additionally, the advent of social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram provided new avenues for businesses to reach customers directly.
            
            Today, e-commerce has become an integral part of the global economy, with giants like Amazon, Alibaba, and Shopify dominating the market. The COVID-19 pandemic further accelerated the growth of e-commerce as consumers turned to online shopping for convenience and safety. Looking ahead, e-commerce continues to evolve with advancements in technology, promising further innovations and opportunities in the digital marketplace.</p>
